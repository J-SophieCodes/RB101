Ex.1 - a method that returns the sum of two integers

*** casual ***
Ask for two integers.
Add the two integers.
Return the result of the sum.

*** formal ***
START

GET first integer
SET num1 = first integer

GET second integer
SET num2 = second integer

SET result = num1 + num2

PRINT result

END

-----------------------------------------------

Ex.2 - a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a 
string that is all those strings concatenated together.

*** casual ***
Given  an array of strings.

Assign an empty string to result as starting value.

Iterate through the array of strings one by one.
 - concatenate the string to result 

After iterating through the array, return the result.

*** formal ***
START

# Given an array of strings called "strings"

SET iterator = 1
SET result = empty string

WHILE iterator <= length of strings array
  result += value within strings array at index "iterator"
  iterator += 1

PRINT result

END

-----------------------------------------------

Ex.3 - a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a 
new array with every other element.

*** casual ***
Given an array of integers.

Iterate through the array of integers one by one.
 - save current value into new array for all odd iterations

After iterating through the array, return the new array.

*** formal ***
START

# Given an array of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET result = empty array

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers array
  SET current_value = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
  
  IF iterator is odd
    result << current_value
  ELSE
    go to the next iteration
  
  iterator += 1

PRINT result
